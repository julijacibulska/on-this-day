# On this day birthdays Wiki list

The app shows the list of historic birthdays that happened on this date after a button click.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

# Note about credentials

Since this is a small test project and authentification was not part of the requirements, it was decided to use Wiki Personal access token. I acknowledge that this is not secure, but since this will not be publicly available for long and is meant for demonstration purposes only, I would consider that a good enough choice. The token is not stored in the repo.

## Note about tests

As this project uses redux-toolkit and redux elements are generated by toolkit utilities, it is not recommended to test parts like action creators and thunks individually. Instead, integration tests are recommended to verify everything is working together.

## Available Scripts
